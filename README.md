# no.js
no.js - a no-compromise Javascript security framework.

Inspired by [secure.js](https://github.com/madrobby/secure.js) and pushing it further to deliver maximum security.

Just include the following line before your own scripts imports, and you're done.
```html
<script src="no.js"></script>
```
